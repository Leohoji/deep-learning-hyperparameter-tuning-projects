<h3>How Do I Complete This Project</h3>

#### Summary of experimental process
<p align='left'>
  <img alt="process of project" src="https://github.com/Leohoji/deep-learning-hyperparameter-tuning-projects/blob/main/introduction_images/process_of_GA_experiment.png?raw=true" width=700 height=400>
</p>

In this project I will follow the following steps to complete my project: 

<h3><ins>Problem definition</ins></h3>

This project is to conquer a prediction problem of time-series data. I would like to apply a evolution algorithms named Genetic Algorithm, short for GA, on LSTM model, a recursive neural network, to find a set of hyperparameters to let the predictions of stock by model be close to real price.

<h3><ins>Data and Features</ins></h3>

The dataset used in this project is a time-series data from from kaggle dataset:

**Training data**: [NASDAQ-100 Stock Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kalilurrahman/nasdaq100-stock-price-data/data?authuser=0), this dataset contains stock prices of all NASDAQ-100 index stocks (as on Sep 2021) from 2010, I only choose AAPL index to predict.

**Testing data**: 2012/01 - 2012/06 APPL historiccal stocck price data.

A **structured data** with **271680** data points, all columns are numerical.

| Columns   | Description                        |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------- |
| Open‚Ää     | Opening Price on that day          |
| High      | High Price on that day             |
| Low       | Low Price on that day              |
| Close     | Closing Price on that day          |
| Adj Close | Adjusted Closing Price on that day |
| Volume    | Volume Traded on that day          |
| Name      | Stock Name (contains 100 stocks)   |

</p>

At present, most people's guess is that the stock price will be related to the previous day or previous data, hence, the previous data is feature, the current day is label. 

<h3><ins>Evaluation</ins></h3>

**Mean Square Error (MSE)** is a common metric for prediction problem, I use it to be the model's loss function and GA's fitness function.

$\text{MSE: } \frac{1}{N}\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}(y_{i} - {\hat{y}})^{2}$

<h3><ins>Modeling</ins></h3>

```python
def LSTM_model(input_shape):
  """
  Create a LSTM model and compile it.
  """
  # Input Layer
  input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape, name='input_layer')

  # LSTM and Dropout layers
  LSTM_1 = LSTM(32, return_sequences=True, activation='tanh', name='lstm_layer_1')(input_layer)
  Dropout_1 = Dropout(0.2, name='dropout_layer_1')(LSTM_1)
  LSTM_2 = LSTM(16, return_sequences=True, activation='tanh', name='lstm_layer_2')(Dropout_1)
  Dropout_2 = Dropout(0.2, name='dropout_layer_2')(LSTM_2)
  LSTM_3 = LSTM(8, activation='tanh', name='lstm_layer_4')(Dropout_2)
  Dropout_3 = Dropout(0.2, name='dropout_layer_4')(LSTM_3)

  # Fully-connected layer
  Dense_layer = Dense(32, name='dense_layer', activation='ReLU')(Dropout_3)
  Dropout_5 = Dropout(0.1, name='dropout_layer_5')(Dense_layer)
  Dense_layer_2 = Dense(16, name='dense_layer_2', activation='ReLU')(Dropout_5)
  Dropout_6 = Dropout(0.1, name='dropout_layer_6')(Dense_layer_2)
  Dense_layer_3 = Dense(8, name='dense_layer_3', activation='ReLU')(Dropout_6)

  # Output Layer
  output_layer = Dense(1, name='output_layer')(Dense_layer_3) # Prediction problem, only one unit of neuron

  # Build model
  model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer, name='LSTM_Stock_Predictor')

  return model
```

<h3><ins>Experiments</ins></h3>

**Data Preprocessing**

1. Read and check the data, I will visualize the AAPL stock price.

2. Rescale the data into range [0, 1] by min-max rescaling using scikit-learn library [API](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html).

3. Create feature and label from data, as present in **Data and Features**, the feature of the time series data is previous `N` day timestamp and the label is `N+1` day timestamp, that is to day, the task of this step is to convert a time series data into a `supervised learning`.

4. Split the dataset into `X` and `y`. Moreover, create the training and testing data ( `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test` ).

**Experiments**

1. Train a baseline model to be the metric of genetic algorithm.

ExperimentaL conditions:

| Hyperparameters     | Values        |
| :-----------------: | :-----------: |
| Rescaling method    | MinMaxScaling |
| Loss function       | mse           |
| Optimizer           | Adam          |
| Learning rates      | 1e-4          |
| Batch size          | 32            |
| Epochs              | 30            |
| Look backs          | 10            |

I also use [ReduceLROnPlateau](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/ReduceLROnPlateau) API for learning rate reduction gradually during training.

2. Apply genetic algorithm (GA) to find better `epoch` and `look_back` hyperparameters.

The detail introduction of GA is written on my medium (Traditional Chinese): [Âü∫Âõ†ÊºîÁÆóÊ≥ï (Genetic Algorithm, GA) ‰ªãÁ¥π](https://medium.com/@leo122196/%E5%9F%BA%E5%9B%A0%E6%BC%94%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95-genetic-algorithm-ga-%E4%BB%8B%E7%B4%B9-62df31c0e670)

ExperimentaL conditions:

| Hyperparameters     | Values        |
| :-----------------: | :-----------: |
| Rescaling method    | MinMaxScaling |
| Loss function       | mse           |
| Optimizer           | Adam          |
| Learning rates      | 1e-4          |
| Batch size          | 32            |
| Epochs              | `??`          |
| Look backs          | `??`          |

Following is the condition I used in GA:

**Population Initialization**: 10 `[epochs, look_back]` group to combine a population with randomly generation.

**Fitness Function**: **Mean Square Error (MSE)**, as well as the loss function used in LSTM model for evaluation.

**Selection**: 

(1) Rank Selection: Choose the top 50% to be offsprings .

(2) Roulette Wheel Selection: Assign the cumulative probability for each fitness individual based on the value.

(3) Tournament Selection: Randomly choose 2 individual to compete.

**Crossover**: The range of crossover rate is [0.5, 1.].

**Mutation**: The mutation rate is fixed to 0.1

**Survivor Selection**:

(1) If the value of offspring is zero or bigger than max value, it will be rejected to the next generation.

(2) If the length of the offspring is less than three, new population will be generated and join it.

**Termination Condition**

(1) Max iteration is set as 100.

(2) Fitness value is better than baseline model.

#### Results

All of selection methods can drive the GA to evolve the better hyperparameter searching.

The evalueation value of baseline model is `0.683`, and it improves to `0.166`, `0.169`, and `0.15` by using GA with Rank Selection, Roulette Wheel Selection, and Tournament Selection respectively.

| Model                    | MSE value | Epochs | Windows (Look Back) |
| -----------------------  | --------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Baseline                 | 0.683     | 28     | 10                  |
| Rank Selection           | 0.166     | 39     | 1                   |
| Roulette Wheel Selection | 0.169     | 31     | 1                   |
| Tournament Selection     | 0.15      | 35     | 1                   |
